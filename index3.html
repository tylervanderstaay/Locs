            <h2>About Drink Assist</h2>
            <p>Have you ever had friends over for drinks and didn't know what to make with what everyone brought?</p>
            <p>It’s easy to become confused or overwhelmed when it comes to making drinks. You are expected to know the different bases, mixers, add-ons and garnishes!</p>
            <p>At Drink Assist, we know you’re not a bartender. </p>
            <p>We’ve created a platform to help you identify your ingredients and match you with the perfect drink, along with the recipe to go with. You’ll never have to worry about messing up a cocktail (and accidentally making another Frankenstein potion) again.</p>

            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>This project was created by Kaylin Flam, Aydene Lopez, Ephrain Reliford, and John Vanderstaay during the University of Central Florida's Coding Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>We are learning full-stack software engineering, and this project uses both a cocktail database and YouTube API to filter your ingredients, match recipes and provide users with a YouTube video to go along with it.</p>
            <p>This project is apart of our growing portfolio to showcase the critical topics we are learning throughout the bootcamp.</p>
